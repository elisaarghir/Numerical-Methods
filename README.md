# Numerical-Methods
The project includes audio signal processing, interpolation methods and preprocessing

# Different Branches for Tasks 

# Numerical Music - Overview 

- The purpose of this task is to familizarize with the field of signal processing, specifically audio signal processing, and provide insight into how programs such as FL Studio or Ableton work.

# Robotzii - Overview 

- In this topic, I will simulate the autonomous part of the robot at a minimalist level through the interpolation methods learned in the course.
- We consider that the robot is on a two-dimensional terrain without bumps, and it needs to discover a trajectory such that it passes through a set of points. Knowing these points, I determined this trajectory using two interpolation methods: Vandermonde and Natural Cubic Splines

# Recommendations - Overview 

- Some reviews are structured as a matrix. Each row represents a client and each column represents a theme. The value in the matrix is the rating of the client for the theme. The rating is an integer between 1 and 10
- Given the very high volume of data, we want to reduce the dimensionality of the matrix by eliminating the clients that contributed the least.
